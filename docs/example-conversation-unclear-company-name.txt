Facebook, now officially known as Meta Platforms, Inc., has transformed into one of the world's most valuable technology companies with a current market capitalization of $1.67 trillion as of late 2025.

**Current Performance:** Meta is experiencing exceptional financial growth, with a 26% revenue increase in Q3 2025. The company has shown remarkable profitability improvements through its "Year of Efficiency" initiatives, which have streamlined operations while maintaining strong growth momentum. Their expanding operating margins demonstrate successful cost management alongside revenue growth.

**Core Business:** While still widely known for Facebook, Meta operates a comprehensive ecosystem of social media platforms and communication services. The company falls under the Communication Services sector, specifically focused on Internet Content & Information. As of December 31st, Meta employs 78,450 full-time employees.

**AI Investment Focus:** Meta is making massive investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure, with planned capital expenditures of $60-65 billion for 2025. Approximately 70% of this investment targets AI infrastructure development. The company aims to achieve 2GW of compute capacity and deploy over 1.3 million GPUs across its data centers by year-end. These AI investments are already showing returns through improved advertising performance.

**Market Position:** Analysts are optimistic about Meta's future, predicting revenue re-acceleration driven by AI-enhanced advertising capabilities. The company's stock has been trading in the $660-670 range recently, reflecting investor confidence in its strategic direction.

**Challenges:** Meta continues to navigate complex regulatory environments, particularly with the European Commission's Digital Markets Act enforcement, though its integrated platform ecosystem provides both defensive advantages and growth opportunities.
